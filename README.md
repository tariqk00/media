# Plaud.ai to Google Drive Automation

This project automates the process of saving Plaud.ai summary emails and their recording attachments to a specific folder in Google Drive.

## Features

- **Gmail Search**: Automatically finds emails from `PLAUD.AI <no-reply@plaud.ai>` with `[PLAUD-AutoFlow]` in the subject.
- **Markdown Conversion**: Saves email content as a Markdown file with the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM [Subject].md`.
- **Attachment Handling**: Saves recording attachments with the same timestamp prefix as the Markdown file.
- **Drive Filing**: Places all files in the `Filing Cabinet/Plaud` directory on Google Drive (creates it if it doesn't exist).
- **Archiving**: Automatically removes processed emails from the Gmail Inbox.

## Structure

- `gmail_mcp.py`: Gmail MCP server with tools for searching, downloading, and archiving.
- `drive_mcp.py`: Drive MCP server with tools for folder and file management.
- `plaud_automation.py`: The coordination script that runs the automation.
